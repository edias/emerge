# FinanceTracker Technical Test

## Overview
FinanceTracker is a simple financial tracking application that allows users to:
- View a list of their transactions
- View a transaction
- Approve transactions from list or detail screen

This application uses modern iOS architecture and technologies including:
- Swift
- SwiftUI for UI
- MVVM architecture
- async/await for asynchronous operations
- ObservableObject for state management

## Your Task
This repository contains a functional but flawed iOS application. Your task is to:

1. Review the code and identify issues related to:
   - Architecture
   - Performance
   - UI implementation
   - Best practices

2. Make a plan and start working through the project fixing the most critical issues first. 

3. Once you are happy with the projects state, then create a pull request explaining the issues and your solutions, submit it and let us know. 

4. Be prepared to discuss your findings and solutions during the technical interview
   - What issues did you find?
   - How did you prioritize them?
   - What solutions did you implement and why?
   - What further improvements would you make with more time?

## Project Setup
1. Unzip the project and commit its contents to a private GitHub repository 
2. Open the project in Xcode
3. Build and run to familiarize yourself with the application
4. You have 90 minutes to identify and fix issues across the project, then improve it where you can and submit a PR
5. Give access to Leo (leonardoduartelana) and Jake (jakesquareone) to review

## Evaluation Criteria
You will be evaluated on:
- Your ability to identify issues in the codebase
- The quality of your fixes
- Your reasoning and explanation of the changes made
- Your understanding of iOS architecture and best practices
- Your knowledge of the technologies used in the project

Good luck!
